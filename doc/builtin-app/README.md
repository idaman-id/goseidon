### Development
```bash
# run using hot reloading #
$ air # default configuration (.air.toml)
$ air -c .air.toml # custom configuration

# run manually #
$ go run \\cmd\\builtin-app\\main.go 

# testing #
$ ginkgo watch -r -v

```

### Deployment

Adjust deployment according to production pipeline, e.g: using `docker`.
But in general we can simply run with the following command:

```bash
# build manually #
$ go build -o ./build/builtin-app/ ./cmd/builtin-app/main.go

# run manually #
$ go run \\cmd\\builtin-app\\main.go 
```
